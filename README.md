# Generating a Dataset with GANs

We used GANs to generate new data from an existing dataset for data augmentation. We use the dataset [Pima Indians Diabetes Database](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database) from Kaggle. All of our code can be found in the notebook [Deep_Learning_From_Scratch_Original.ipynb](/Deep_Learning_From_Scratch_Original.ipynb). 

Our approach is based on the paper [Data Augmentation Using GANs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09135) by Fabio Henrique K. dos S. Tanaka.
